# Geospatial Coding Example

This is example code from a technical challenge I did in 2023. I have removed all references to the specific company and merely want to use my work to demostrate my coding processes.

This contains all the output files (figures and geojson file) and the jupyter notebook showing off some of my geospatial work.

notes: I use `plotly` for interactive plots. These interactive elements may not display when viewing the Jupyter Notebook without running through the code.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.
